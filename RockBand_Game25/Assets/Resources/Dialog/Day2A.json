Do you have any idea-\n->I do what I want\n    Aig: I do what I want. You're not my manager.\nJ-Pe: We're a TEAM, Aig. And being in this team means I handle this sort of thing. I'm better at it anyway.\nOnce again, you grab a flyer off his bunk.\nAig: This doesn't even say \"J-Pe and the Boys\" on it anymore--which, by the way is not even the name of the group.\nAig: This is just a photo of you!\nJ-Pe: Aiggy, I know what I'm doing.  Trust me! Teamwork makes the dream work!\n<<move Jaypee StageRight1>>\nJ-Pe: I don't suppose you want to end up like...HIM, do you?\n<<flip Jaypee>>\nYour gaze lingers briefly on the wreath and candles--the only things you have to remember the bed's previous occupant by.\nAig: Um...no...?\n<<flip Jaypee>>\nJ-Pe: Yeah, that's what I thought.\n",
