I didn't hear you come in.\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\nAig, we need to talk.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig Neutral>>\nOh, uh...s-sure.\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\nAig, I don't want to rattle you a week out from your debut, but I just have to be blunt.\nI don't know where you fit in this band.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\nW-what do you mean.\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\nI mean, marketing has no idea how to package you.\nLook, all around you're doing...fine...in your training, but not you're not a standing out in anything.\nYou can move, but you're not really a \"dancer.\"\nYou can sing, but you're not a \"Singer\" with a capital 'S.'\nAnd you've got a little bit of a fan following, but...\n...well, you're not J-Pe.\nDo you see what I'm, saying?\n->I'm trying to be well-rounded.\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    I always thought that I could be the \"well-rounded one.\"\n    <<expression Aig Happy>>\n    You know, a little bit of this, a little bit of that.  \n    <<expression Aig Neutral>>\n    That's a thing...right?\n    <<name Friendship Kent>>\n    Oh, Aig.\n    Do you know what another word for \"well-rounded\" is?\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    You mean, like, jack of all-\n    <<name Friendship Kent>>\n    Boring.\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    Boring?\n    <<name Friendship Kent>>\n    Boring.\n    Trust me, nobody has ever succeeded in this business by being \"the well-rounded one.\"\n    Survived, maybe, but certainly not succeeded.\n    And I get it, it's important to have SOME skills across the board. You don't want to be the one slowing down the band when it's go time.\n    But you don't want to be...boring.  You get me?\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    I...think so?\n->I think so.\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    I...guess so.\n    You're saying I'm not good at anything?\n    <<name Friendship Kent>>\n    Exactly!\n",

Find something that is uniquely \"Aig.\"\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\nHow do I do that?\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\nSpecialize.\nGet good at something...anything.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\nWhat should I specialize in?\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\nI don't care.

I'll give it a try.\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\nGood. Now get to it.\nYou've only got one week left before you're debut, so crunch time.\nExciting! Right?\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\nY-yeah.
